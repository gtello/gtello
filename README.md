# Gabriel Tello

Cybersecurity-focused technologist that likes building secure, automated, and intelligent systems across cloud, software, and infrastructure layers. Operating at the intersection of security engineering, cloud platforms, and automation.

Focused on eliminating manual security gaps by embedding controls directly into infrastructure, pipelines, and applications. I leverage and implement AI-driven tooling where it makes sense, improving detection, response, and decision-making at scale without adding unnecessary complexity.

## 🔐 Core Focus Areas

### Cybersecurity Engineering
- Penetration testing and vulnerability assessment  
- Threat modeling and adversary mapping (MITRE ATT&CK)  
- SIEM, threat hunting, log analysis, and system hardening  
- Identity & access management, risk assessment
- Security playbooks for incident response, alert triage, and containment    

### Cloud & DevSecOps
- Secure cloud architectures on **AWS** and **Azure**  
- Cloud security posture management and workload protection  
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform) and containerized environments  
- CI/CD pipelines with security controls baked in  

### AI & Intelligent Automation
- AI integration for security operations and business workflows  
- OpenAI API and GenAI-powered automation  
- Event-driven automation with serverless and low-code platforms
